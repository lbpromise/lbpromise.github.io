    <title>Physical-layer Security Technologies and Applications for B5G and 6G</title>
    <url>/2021/05/10/vtc/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Scopes"><a href="#Scopes" class="headerlink" title="Scopes"></a>Scopes</h2><ul>
<li>This workshop 2021 mainly focuses on the development of physical-layer security (PLS) technologies and its potential applications for the future beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) networks. The tremendous growth in connectivity and the ubiquity of wireless communications has resulted in an unprecedented awareness of the importance of security and privacy. Achieving secure and trusted communications is vital for the deployment of future intelligent connected applications, especially life-critical vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. However, the heterogeneous, dynamic and decentralized architecture of these networks leads to difficulties for cryptographic key management and distribution. By exploiting the physical characteristics of devices, wireless channels and noise, PLS offers reliable solutions against eavesdropper attacks as complementary approaches to cryptographic techniques.</li>
