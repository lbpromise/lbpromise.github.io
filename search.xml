    <title>Physical-layer Security Technologies and Applications for B5G and 6G</title>
    <url>/2021/04/28/vtc/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Scope"><a href="#Scope" class="headerlink" title="Scope"></a>Scope</h2><p>  This workshop 2021 mainly focuses on the development of physical-layer security (PLS) technologies and its potential applications for the future beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) networks. The tremendous growth in connectivity and the ubiquity of wireless communications has resulted in an unprecedented awareness of the importance of security and privacy. Achieving secure and trusted communications is vital for the deployment of future intelligent connected applications, especially life-critical vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. However, the heterogeneous, dynamic and decentralized architecture of these networks leads to difficulties for cryptographic key management and distribution. By exploiting the physical characteristics of devices, wireless channels and noise, PLS offers reliable solutions against eavesdropper attacks as complementary approaches to cryptographic techniques.</p>
<h2 id="Topics"><a href="#Topics" class="headerlink" title="Topics"></a>Topics</h2><p>The workshop aims at sharing the advancements in the PLS field and spreading the adoption in scenarios of B5G and 6G. In order to spark more ideas and future research, we will invite experts and scholars in relevant fields around the world to share their insights into the topics of physical layer security model, mechanism and applications in B5G and 6G networks. We hope to foster an exchange of research results, experiences, and products in the physical layer security domain from both a theoretical and practical perspective.</p>
